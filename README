This is where I'll put random scripts and stuff I want to make available
to the public, but which aren't really big enough to have their own
project.

Some things here are likely to be half-baked or minimally tested. I try
to write reasonably portable code, but a lot of this stuff has only been
tested on one platform (usually Linux (Ubuntu) or OS-X with MacPorts).

Use at your own risk.


media/
======
Stuff for dealing with "media" (music, video, photos).

media/dvdrip/dvdrip.py
----------------------
A wrapper script for ripping DVDs. Uses HandbrakeCLI. Currently Mac
only, but probably easy to port to Linux.
