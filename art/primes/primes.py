  Where factorizations is a tuple of tuples. Each sub-tuple contains the
  prime factors of its index in the outer tuple.

  For example, factorizations[12] == (2, 2, 3)

  Note that element 0 and 1 are empty.

  prime_to_color is a dict that maps from primes to a unique index.
  These indices are "packed". This is handly if you want to have
  per-prime information in an array.

  The implementation is based on the sieve of Eratosthenes, with the
  added wrinkle that we don't just mark numbers as composite, but
  actually record all of their factors. We also keep track of duplicate
  factors (eg: 12 has one 3 and two 2s) so we have additional iterations
  for each power of the prime.
